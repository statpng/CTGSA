Description: There have been many studies to reveal the outcome related genes associated with a disease or a trait. Unlike the methods to compare the gene expression levels with mean scale, our study is focusing the coexpression of genes by regulatory factors in a gene set. We propose the CTGSA which calculates a statistic with thresholded correlation matrix and gives the selection of tuning parameter through percentile of correlations. It also calculates p-values which control the type I error rate.
